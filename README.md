# Machine_Learning_Final_Project
To run the application go to main.py. Unfortunatly when I tried to run the project after obtaining the dataset from kaggle, I noticed the data was not cleaned. In the video that goes over the summary of the project you had a version of it that was cleaned. So I cleaned the data for the final model. When the project is ran, it will generate a cleaned model. You can also check the heart.py to find my code there.
